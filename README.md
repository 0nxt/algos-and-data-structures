# Algos & Data Structures
### (work in progress)

### An interactive overview of common sorting algorithms and data structures, implemented in JavaScript. Also includes several other miscellaneous algorithm challenges, similar to those asked in programming interviews. This is intended to help you brush up on your computer science fundamentals, algorithm, and problem solving skills as you prepare for interviews! This is meant as a reference / review only &mdash; if you haven't already learned / solved these problems on your own, I recommend giving them a try before looking at the code!

This project uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) to embed an editor into the browser, and a hack that hijacks the consoles messages to output messages into a mock console so that you can see the code's output without having to have the browser's devtools open.

## Contents:
### Sorting Algorithms:
- Quicksort
- Mergesort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Heap Sort _(coming soon)_
- Sorting Algorithm Benchmarks

### Data Structures:
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List _(coming soon)_
- Stack _(coming soon)_
- Queue _(coming soon)_
- Tree / Binary Tree _(coming soon)_
- Heap _(coming soon)_

### Algorithm Challenges
**Easy:**
- Sum All Primes _(coming soon)_
- Is Palindrome _(coming soon)_
- Fizz Buzz _(coming soon)_
**Moderate/Difficult:**
- No Two Consecutive Chars _(coming soon)_
- Sum Prime Factors _(coming soon)_
- Anagram Palindrome
- Rotate An Image _(coming soon)_
- Sum Prime Factors _(coming soon)_
- Anagram Palindrome _(coming soon)_

## To Install:
- Fork repo, clone locally, and run `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Install the [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) package globally
- In the root directory, run `yarn start` or `npm start`
- In a new console tab, in the same directory, run `live-server`, which should launch the app on port 8080

**\*I will be launching this live soon, once it's complete**

### \*\*_Challenge!_
Some of my solutions are less than perfect. If you come up with a better one, or want to add a new algorithm or data structure that I haven't covered, feel free to submit a PR!
